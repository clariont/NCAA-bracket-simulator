This is a simple NCAA bracket simulator using the 538 prediction data.

538 predictions are interpreted as simple win probabilities.  For example,
\#8 Wisconsin has a 79% chance of reaching Round 2 and an 18% chance of reaching 
Round 3 (Sweet 16). Therefore Wisconsin has a 0.18/0.79 = 0.22 chance of winning 
their Round 2 game.  Of course, this doesn't take into account the opponents, that is,
whether they play \#1 Villanova or \#16 Mount St. Mary's. One can think of this as 
implicitly giving a boost to underdogs, and increasing the upset potential.
